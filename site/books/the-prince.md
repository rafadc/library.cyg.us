## Summary in one paragraph

Consciously thinking in the people dynamics in any group of people is important. It is written in the context of government and touches subjects such as loyalty or culture. It was great reading about how cultures are created from the broader perspective of nations more than the perspective of a company.

I abandoned it but just because the second half of the book is too focused on history of Italy and I am not that interested in the topics as of now.

## What changed in me after this book?

I never thought as coldly as he states in the book about how you can influence groups of people by changing some group dynamics.
