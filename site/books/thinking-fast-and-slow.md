## Summary in one paragraph

Our mind is composed of two Systems, one acts intuitively and is good for fast thinking and the other one acts analytically and takes more effort to use. We tend to think we are rational but our intuitive part takes over most of the time. Being analytical takes too much effort. This causes that most of our decisions are more irrational that what we like to admit.

## What changed in me after this book?

Meanwhile it is true that random things affect most of the outcome it is true that knowing this may have a positive impact in the margin. The more aware we are of this the better. Also, knowing that most of our estimation errors come from trying to hard is eye opening. We tend to overcomplicate things.
