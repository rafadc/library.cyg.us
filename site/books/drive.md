This is a great book on motivation.

You get most of it by seeing one of the [multiple summaries you can find online](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhJ4CDCfASI). The book just digs deeper into a few core concepts. There is one of the mental frameworks in the book I use the most when talking on motivation.

> The three pillars of motivation are:
>
> - Autonomy
> - Mastery
> - Purpose
