# The library of the Joy of Programming

I love reading books. This is a tiny library with some notes on the books I've read.

Taking notes is the best way of reflecting about information so this is my tiny experiment.

The whole site is built using scripts and [Pandoc](http://www.pandoc.org). Feel free to check [the github repo](https://github.com/rafadc/library.joy.pm) to see how it is built.

Feel free to check [my blog](http://joy.pm) or [my twitter account](https://twitter.com/rafadc/).
