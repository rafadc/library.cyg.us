# The library of joy.pm

This site is generated using pandoc.

We need to generate some metadata for the parts of the code that are not static.

To generate the site just run `make` in the root directory. The site will be built in the `output` directory.

Special thanks to the [OpenLibrary](https://openlibrary.org).

## Development

There is a makefile that builds one file per md file we place in the site directory. Just take into account that md extension is replaced by html when converting in case you are using links.
